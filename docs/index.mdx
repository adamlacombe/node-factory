# Node Factory

When developing or testing your application, you might need to mock data comming from a database or an endpoint. Instead of manually generating "random" data, you can use model factories.
This package allows you to define a default set of attributes for each of your endpoints or models and easily mock responses.

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save-dev node-factory
// or
yarn add -D node-factory
```
