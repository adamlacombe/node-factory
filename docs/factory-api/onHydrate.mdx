# `Factory<T, S>.onHydrate`

## Description

If you are using some sort of ORM/model system and you wish that the generated data is return as
an instance of your model, you can define a strategy to hydrate the model class with the newly
generated data. Using the `onHydrate` method, you can pass a function that receives the generated
data and should return your model. This function is called by the `create`, `make` and `state`
methods before returning the data.

## Type

```typescript
type OnHydrateMethod<T> = (func: (data: T) => any): Factory<T, S>;
```

### args

- `function `<span>`(data: T) => any`</span>

### return

- `Factory<T, S>`

## Example

```typescript
UserFactory.onHydrate((data: User) {
  return new UserModel(data);
});
```
